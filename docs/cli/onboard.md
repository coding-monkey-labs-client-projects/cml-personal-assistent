# `cml-hive-assist onboard`

Interactive onboarding wizard (local or remote Gateway setup).

Related:

- Wizard guide: [Onboarding](/start/onboarding)

## Examples

```bash
cml-hive-assist onboard
cml-hive-assist onboard --flow quickstart
cml-hive-assist onboard --flow manual
cml-hive-assist onboard --mode remote --remote-url ws://gateway-host:18789
```

Flow notes:

- `quickstart`: minimal prompts, auto-generates a gateway token.
- `manual`: full prompts for port/bind/auth (alias of `advanced`).
- Fastest first chat: `cml-hive-assist dashboard` (Control UI, no channel setup).
